# HORISEON MARKETING 

## DESCRIPTION

I HELPED HORISEON MARKETING AGENCY EDIT THE CODE FOR THEIR WEBSITE TO HELP FOLLOW ACCESSIBILITY STANDARDS AND OPTIMIZE THEIR SITE FOR SEARCH ENGINES. 

HORISEON MARKETING ALREADY HAD A GREAT LANDING PAGE. I CAME IN AND FIXED A LINK IN THE NAVIGATION BAR, ADDED ACCESSIBLE ALT ATTRIBUTES TO THE IMAGES, CLEANED UP HTML TO HAVE SEMANTIC ELEMENTS, FOLLOWED SEQUENTIAL ORDER FOR HEADING ATTRIBUTES THROUGHOUT THE CODE, ADDED A TITLE TO THE WEBPAGE, AND CONSOLIDATED AND REARRANGED STYLES IN CSS.  

## USAGE

WITH THE NAVIGATION BAR IN THE HEADER, YOU CAN CLICK AND READ MORE ABOUT SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION, ONLINE REPUTATION MANAGEMENT, AND SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING.  

IF YOU SCROLL DOWN YOU CAN SEE THE CONTENT SECTION AND THE BENEFITS SECTION. THE CONTACT SECTION FEATURES A PHOTO, A HEADING, AND A PARAGRAPH FOR SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION, ONLINE REPUTATION MANAGEMENT, AND SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING. THE BENEFITS SECTION IS TO THE LEFT AND FEATURES A HEADING, GRAPHIC, AND SENTENCE ABOUT LEAD GENERATION, BRAND AWARENESS, AND COST MANAGEMENT.
