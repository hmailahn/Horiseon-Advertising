Horiseon Marketing
I helped Horiseon Marketing agency edit the code for their website to help follow accesibility standards and optimize their site for search engines.

Here is a screenshot of the finished product: https://github.com/hmailahn/Horiseon-marketing/blob/main/assets/images/Screenshot-of-project.png

Horiseon Marketing already had a great landing page. I came in and fixed a link in the navigation bar, added accesible alt attributes to the images, cleaned up html to have semantic elements, followeed sequential order for heading attributes throughout the code, added a title to the webpage, and consolidated and rearranged styles in css. 

With the navigation bar in the header, you can click and read more about search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing.
